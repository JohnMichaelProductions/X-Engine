# X-Engine Weekly Newsletter

### Week 10: April 27th, 2020 - May 3rd, 2020
Got work done this week not much, I have lots of other projects and school work to do so I'm slowing production down on X-Engine, I'm putting school first but once June hits,(end of school) I'll work more extensively on X-Engine.

### Week 9: April 20th, 2020 - April 26th, 2020
No work done this week, I was catching up on school work. I will work on X-Engine this week but I want to work on some other projects as well, I'm going to stay more oganized now so I'll be able to do a lot more from now on.

### Week 8: April 13th, 2020 - April 19th, 2020
Good news, I finished all the weeks long of work I needed to do and I can now do a lot of work on X-Engine. Like usaul I didn't get to do work on X-Engine today, although I can say I will mosty likely be able to work on X-Engine a lot this week! Thanks for the patience.

### Week 7: April 6th, 2020 - April 12th, 2020
Again did not work on X-Engine that much, although should be able to this week, maybe at least a little bit I hope. I'm hoping I will be done being busy by April 21st. Whats good is that the rest of school is canceled as of now, all I need to do is online assignments that should take long so when I get back working I should be able to work until September.

### Week 6: March 30th, 2020 - April 5th, 2020
Didn't have time to do any work this week. I'll be busy once again this week and maybe next week. Although I'll probably get to work on X-Engine a little bit this week. I have other projects I want to work on this week too, I guess you could say X-Engine is on hold right now.

### Week 5: March 23th, 2020 - March 29th, 2020
I didn't achieve much this week, I was pretty busy, didn't finish the renderer either, so my goal for this week is finally to finish it. I'll still be busy this week but I'm hoping I'll be able to work a lot on X-Engine. I am supposed to do some school work though, so I'll be extra busy, I will try my best to work on the Engine though.

### Week 4: March 16th, 2020 - March 22th, 2020
This week I was mostly working on understanding OpenGL and building the renderer with that knowledge, this week I got a lot of X-Engine organized but I also got basic rendering features finished, like context and the abstraction layer. I don't know what will be in store for this week since I'll be busy a lot and won't be able to work on X-Engine as much, I want to aim for at least one thing done everyday, so that'll at least happen.

With that in mind I want to finish a basic version of the renderer, one that is complete and can be used, obviously I'll have to make improvements to it in the future. So the renderer will be prety much finished by the end of the week I'm hoping. That's pretty much all I have to say for this week I'm hoping next week will be more eventful.

### Week 3: March 9th, 2020 - March 15th, 2020
This third week I got to finish setting up the basic fundamentals of the core of X-Engine, I'm still having some issues with the premake files though, and I'm planning to finish that monday and release a build of the engine through github. The features that I got done this week to finish the project set-up were input polling, mouse and key codes, adding a math library, and getting docking and viewports to work with ImGui.

I'm also very excited to start heavy development on X-Engine, school is canceled for at least six weeks because of the coronavirus, so I'm going to be focusing all my energy to X-Engine in these six weeks, I'll also do other things as well, like working on my github page/website and learning more about 3D modeling.

Next week I want to release a development build of X-Engine like I said, and I want to get started on the renderer and possibly finish it. One of the things that I didn't get to was to make sense of the engine and explain all of it, I think this is important to do so I want to make time to do this more so for my personal learning, but also for others to understand whats happening under the hood. Anyways that's what I'm thinking, and that's all I have to say this week.

### Week 2: March 2nd, 2020 - March 8th, 2020
This week I worked on a lot of visual things like the window abstraction layer, and ImGui. I also got an event callback system to work with a new layer system so the user can interact with ImGui. This week I want to finish up the project setup, so that next week I can start on the renderer.

I also want to learn a bit more about C++, and work on understanding the engine that I'm writing, I am following a tutorial from The Cherno, a programmer on youtube, I want follow the tutorial but once I understand and get a good feel of C++ I want to solo develop and add features myself. So the goal is to finish the project setup(Layers, Events, ect.) and fully understand the engine so far. I also want to work a bit on my github page for the John Michael Productions organization, so I'll finish that quickly then go straight back to development of X-Engine.

### Week 1: February 24th, 2020 - March 1st, 2020
A lot was finished in the week of development for X-Engine, the project was set up for all IDE's. The Logging System, and Event System were implemented. A Pre-Compiled Header file was also added to increase building performance. Not much progress on the game engine itself was made. Although I do think it's important that we set up debugging(logging, events) first, in the long run the engine development will only benefit from it.

Rainfall City(A Bruh Studio Game) will be developed using this engine, in fact it will be developed whilst the engine is in being developed. Rainfall City development probably won't start for a while, because all the development focus will be on X-Engine for now. The plan is to get X-Engine to a good spot in development where it can start creating games, and then begin development on Rainfall City. With that being said the art and music will be developed even though the game itself isn't in development.
