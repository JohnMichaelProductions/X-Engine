# X-Engine Weekly Newsletter

### Week 2: March 2nd, 2020 - March 8th, 2020
This week I worked on a lot of visual things like the window abstraction layer, and ImGui. I also got an event callback system to work with a new layer system so the user can interact with ImGui. This week I want to finish up the project setup, so that next week I can start on the renderer.

I also want to learn a bit more about C++, and work on understanding the engine that I'm writing, I am following a tutorial from The Cherno, a programmer on youtube, I want follow the tutorial but once I understand and get a good feel of C++ I want to solo develop and add features myself. So the goal is to finish the project setup(Layers, Events, ect.) and fully understand the engine so far. I also want to work a bit on my github page for the John Michael Productions organization, so I'll finish that quickly then go straight back to development of X-Engine.

### Week 1: February 24th, 2020 - March 1st, 2020
A lot was finished in the week of development for X-Engine, the project was set up for all IDE's. The Logging System, and Event System were 
implemented. A Pre-Compiled Header file was also added to increase building performance. Not much progress on the game engine itself was
made. although I do think its important that we set up debugging(logging, events) first, in the long run the engine development will only
benefit from it.

Rainfall City(A Bruh Studio Game) will be development using this engine, in fact it will be development whilst the engine is in being
developed. Rainfall City development probably won't start for a while, because all the development focus will be on X-Engine for now. The
plan is to get X-Engine to a good spot in development where it can start creating games, and then begin development on Rainfall City. With
that being said the art and music will be developed even though the game itself isn't in development.
