# X-Engine Weekly Newsletter

### Week 1: February 24th, 2020 - March 1st, 2020
A lot was finsihed in the week pf development for X-Engine, the project was set up for all IDE's. The Logging System, and Event System were 
implemented. A Pre-Compiled Header file was also added to increase building performance. Not much progress on the game engine itself was
made. although I do think its important that we set up debugging(logging, events) first, in the long run the engine development will only
benefit from it.

Rainfall City(A Bruh Studio Game) will be development using this engine, in fact it will be development whilist the engine is in being
developed. Rainfall City development probably won't start for a while, becuase all the development focus will be on X-Engine for now. The
plan is to get X-Engine to a good spot in development where it can start creating games, and then begin devlopment on Rainfall City. With
that being said the art and music will be developed even though the game itself isn't in development.
